TAREFAS:
- Refatorar gerenciador de tiles:
    - Os tiles devem ser armazenados em arrays
    


THINGS TO IMPLEMENT:

- Collision detection:
    Implement an basic collision detection system.
    Doesn't need to be super precise, but functional.
    Try make a very modular system, separeted from the others parts of the game.
    That way, it's possible to rewrite it later.

- Game assets:
    It's time to make the game look like a game, implement an assets system. 
    Look for the best way to organize 'game logic' with 'game data'.

- Event system: 
    Featuring various key presses, mouse clicks/mouse coordinates.
    Event queue, handling more than one event per frame.
    Polished keyboard input.

- Entity System:
    Don't know how to architect this yet, but something like this:
    Try to unify entities, all interactable-world-objects.
    Store entities in an array, and render all entities at once.
